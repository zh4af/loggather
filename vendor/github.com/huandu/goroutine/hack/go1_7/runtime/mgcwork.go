// A gcWork provides the interface to produce and consume work for the

// A gcWork can be used on the stack as follows:
//
//     (preemption must be disabled)
//     gcw := &getg().m.p.ptr().gcw
//     .. call gcw.put() to produce and gcw.get() to consume ..
//     if gcBlackenPromptly {
//         gcw.dispose()
//     }
//
// It's important that any use of gcWork during the mark phase prevent
// the garbage collector from transitioning to mark termination since
// gcWork may locally hold GC work buffers. This can be done by
// disabling preemption (systemstack or acquirem).
