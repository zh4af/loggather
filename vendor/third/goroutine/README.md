# Hacking goroutine #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/huandu/goroutine.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/huandu/goroutine)

Package goroutine is merely a hack.
It exports goroutine id to outside so that you can use it for whatever purpose.
However, it's highly recommended to not use this package in your daily life.
It may be broken at any go release as it's a hack.

## Usage ##

Get the latest version through `go get -u github.com/huandu/goroutine`.

Get current goroutine id with `goroutine.GoroutineId()`.

```go
// Get id of current goroutine.
var id int64 = goroutine.GoroutineId()
println(id)
```

See [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/huandu/goroutine) for more details.

## Supported builds ##

Package goroutine is not well tested due to lack of test machines.
Ideally, it should work on all go >= go1.5.

Tested platforms.
* Darwin (Mac OSX 10.11.6) + amd64 CPU
    * go1.5.1
    * go1.6.3
    * go1.7
    * go1.7.1
    * go1.7.3
* Travis CI (See https://travis-ci.org/huandu/goroutine)
    * go1.5
    * go1.5.1
    * go1.5.2
    * go1.5.3
    * go1.5.4
    * go1.6
    * go1.6.1
    * go1.6.2
    * go1.6.3
    * go1.7
    * go1.7.1
    * go1.7.2
    * go1.7.3

## How it works ##

Go runtime inside a Go program binary is statically linked. It means, if I know Go version and runtime source code for
this version, I can copy struct declaration from runtime package source to my package and cast runtime internal pointers
to its underlying struct safely. As Go source code is open for everyone, I can always find the right struct for an
interesting runtime pointer and then manipulate it.

In this package, I just get current goroutine pointer (copy the `getg()` implementation from compiler), cast it to a right
struct and then return the id. It sounds simple but of course not. The struct `g` refers to many other internal types defined
in `runtime` package. I cannot simply copy some necessary types to make it work. I have to scan all types and constants in
`runtime` and its internal packages to make the struct `g` well defined. Another challenge is that Go authors update
`runtime` structs in nearly every major version (or even in a minor version). I have to maintain hacked code for every Go
release respectively. I develop a semi-automatical tool to make things easier. The tool is not smart enough.  I may need to
think of other better way to avoid to generate hacked source code for every Go release.

NOTE: Starting from go1.7.2, Go compiler generates some constant definitions for `runtime` package according to build flags and
environment when building. It makes current hack impossible to handle all posibile flags and environment combinations. I make a
hack to detour it and no impact to the major task of this package - get goroutine id. However, it's not a perfect solution.

I'm thinking of a perfect solution. If you have any suggestion, please open issue and let me know. Many thanks.
